# NI Metro-style Maps
Metro-style maps of public transport in Northern Ireland. There are three different versions, which I don't manage to keep in sync:

- Plausible - what the network could look like if the solid (funded and unfunded) proposals are implemented. More information on this one below. This is the map used at http://www.sustainablemobility-ni.uk/.
- Dream - what the network could look like if even more extensive railway reopenings took place
- Current - how the network looks right now if you consider rail and coach services as mostly mutually exclusive (i.e. rail over bus) and ignore short missing links and include ferries (TODO...)

The files are SVG vectors, PNG renderings get uploaded as they are a bit of effort to make, but the SVG should always be considered the master. You can edit the files directly in Inkscape.

## Plausible Map
This map assumes the following proposals/projects are implemented/finished:
- The [All Island Strategic Rail Review](https://assets.gov.ie/264977/84a63257-d41d-4d13-804c-6e1142c4c629.pdf), but assumes for simplicity, that any capacity improvements between Belfast and Lisburn follow the existing route.
- The [Condor Ferries shuttle service between Titanic Quarter and Bangor Marina](https://www.bailiwickexpress.com/jsy/news/watch-closer-look-condors-new-100-electric-ferry/).
- The [Circle Line upgrades around Belfast/Antrim/Lisburn](https://twitter.com/CircleLineBT).
- The [Narrowwater bridge](http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/roads/carlingfordloughbridge.html).
- The [proposed Glider Extensions to Carryduff and Glengormley](https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/belfast-news/north-south-glider-routes-announced-25320319).

Furthermore, a bunch of easy-to-achieve shuttle services and interchanges are provided:
- The northbound Glider extension is extended further to a rail interchange at Mossley West.
- Yorkgate station is connected to the ferry terminals for Liverpool, Cairnryan and the Isle of Man. It's not shown yet, but with the proposed footbridge between Titanic Quarter and the other side of Belfast Lough, this could become a mega rail/Glider-interchange for all ferries, especially if the footbridge was provided with a roof and open sides.
- The new Narrowwater bridge is used to provide Newcastle to Dundalk bus services.
- The Lough Foyle ferry becomes connected with a bus or buses to provide a link from the Donegal Northern Headlands to the Derry-Londonderry coastal railway line at Bellarina. Admittantly, I have no idea if this makes economic sense, but there are other bus services in walking/tourist territory (the Mourne, Causeway services) and I wanted to include all of NI's ferry services.
- In general, bus/train interchanges are considered seamless, even though this is not the case in some places.

Not included are tourist/heritage railways, in particular the Downpatrick & County Down Railway and the Giant's Causeway & Bushmills Railway. But maybe extending and utilising these services as high frequency links could be considered one day.

Intermediate bus and glider stations are not shown, but all rail stations are. Whether new stations (e.g. Belfast Int'l Airport and Limavady) are added using spurs off a line or by redirecting a line/redirecting services is ignored for simplicity.
