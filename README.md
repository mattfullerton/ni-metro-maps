# NI Metro-style Maps
Metro-style maps of public transport in Northern Ireland. There are three different versions, which I don't manage to keep in sync:

- Plausible - what the network could look like if the solid (funded and unfunded) proposals are implemented. More information on this one below. This is the map used at http://www.sustainablemobility-ni.uk/.
- Dream - what the network could look like if even more extensive railway reopenings took place
- Current - how the network looks right now if you consider rail and coach services as mostly mutually exclusive (i.e. rail over bus) and ignore short missing links and include ferries (TODO...)

The files are SVG vectors, PNG renderings get uploaded as they are a bit of effort to make, but the SVG should always be considered the master. You can edit the files directly in Inkscape.
